# Project
In this project we are going tpo deploy a streamlit based application in the hugging face platform.
For this process, we will be using Github and hugging face stream and visual studio code.

Firstly, create a virtual environment to install all the necessary libraries and store them in a file.
Now, we will create a python file i.e., app.py to run the code which we will be pushing into the feature branch.
The URL of the hugging face deployed application: https://huggingface.co/spaces/navNjit/sentimental-analysis.
